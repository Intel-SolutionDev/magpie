# Environment Variable Script
#
# When working with Magpie interactively by logging into the master
# node of your job allocation, many environment variables may need to
# be set.  For example, environment variables for config file
# directories (e.g. HADOOP_CONF_DIR, HBASE_CONF_DIR, etc.) and home
# directories (e.g. HADOOP_HOME, HBASE_HOME, etc.) and more general
# environment variables (e.g. JAVA_HOME) may need to be set before you
# begin interacting with your big data setup.
#
# The standard job output from Magpie provides instructions on all the
# environment variables typically needed to interact with your job.
# However, this can be tedious if done by hand.
#
# If the environment variable specified below is set, Magpie will
# create the file and put into it every environment variable that
# would be useful when running your job interactively.  That way, it
# can be sourced easily if you will be running your job interactively.
# It can also be loaded or used by other job scripts.
#
# export MAGPIE_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_SCRIPT="${HOME}/my-job-env"

# Environment Variable Shell Type
#
# Magpie outputs environment variables in help output and
# MAGPIE_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_SCRIPT based on your SHELL environment
# variable.
#
# If you would like to output in a different shell type (perhaps you
# have programmed scripts in a different shell), specify that shell
# here.
#
# export MAGPIE_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_SCRIPT_SHELL="/bin/bash"
